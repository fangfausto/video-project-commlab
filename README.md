# The Newsroom
## By Sara, Naijah, Sneheel, and Fausto

# What is the project? What is the overall concept and theme? What kind of experience you were striving to create?

For our video project, we wrote, produced, and edited The Newsroom, a The Office-style mockumentary of a breaking news segment that interviews three citizens-turned-superheroes. After the breaking news segment is introduced by news anchor Polly Esther, we follow co-anchor Holly Day around campus as she meets individuals with:
- Powers of invisibility
- Mind reading abilities
- Superspeed
- Spontaneous combustion 

We strove to create a facetious tone to the piece, using names like Polly Esther and Holly Day as a play on words, being overly serious at times to contrast with the sometimes ridiculous responses of the interviewees, and breaking the fourth wall often to let the audience in on the joke. Our tongue-in-cheek news segment centers around superheroes, a theme that allowed us not only to brainstorm several ideas for interesting events that otherwise wouldn’t be possible in the real world, but also to utilize the technical skills of our team members who could use special effects and other editing talents.

The experience we were striving to create was centered largely around letting the film do the talking, while also building the website to accomodate this art form rather than distracting from it. We wanted it to be lighthearted and enjoyable while also displaying some of our technical filmmaking skills.

# How did you go about implementing the concept?
Before we even began filming, we had to storyboard our plan for the film. This meant we had to write a script and then designate a specific shot and movement with an accompanying type of filming equipment. In our case, we used either a:
- Camera
- iPhone

depending on the shot, and then alternated between each.

## Pre-production
- Brainstorming together, considering different tools/skills we have to inform the ideas we could possibly execute (SFX, editing, coding, etc.)
- Organizing and writing: making a shared google doc, drafting equipment lists
- Scheduling booking times for equipment, having to navigate scarce availability of equipment as everyone is trying to book for their project & capstones are shooting
Couldn't get access to the same lenses on day 2 as we did on day 1

## Shooting
After writing out our ideas, planning out shot lists, booking our equipment, and handling the logistics, we were able to start shooting. We shot in three different sessions to accommodate the team’s availability and film in the best locations we could find for each scene. 

On Day 1, we filmed the introduction and conclusion scenes with Polly Esther in the studio, as well as the mind reader scene. As these were all indoor, they did not require ND filters. 

On Day 2, we learned a lesson about batteries. We booked several smaller batteries in case any died, but realized that having to constantly change out batteries is a hassle, regardless of if you have enough of them or not. 

We opted for the larger v-lock battery on Day 3, which made shooting much more seamless. We also learned on Day 2 that a wider lens creates a better frame for our images, and so we opted for it on Day 3. 

While shooting, we played around with lighting, moving in and out of shadow, and using the ND filter to properly expose the image while outdoors. We also used the zebra lines setting on the camera to tell when the image was overexposed, and even had to reshoot a scene in a different location once we realized the exposure in the original location was too high. Using these techniques, we got well-exposed video in several different locations for the video.

## Editing


## Each of our roles were very much multi-disciplinary and well rounded, with each person getting a chance to:
- Script/ storyboard
- Act
- Film
- Handle audio

# Reflection/Evaluation (initial vs final concept, expectations and goals)

## Fausto
In general terms, I am more than satisfied with the end product we have created. This project was one of the most entertaining projects I worked on. Initially, I was slightly worried because I do not have an extensive background on film making or photography, which meant that the learning curve for the use of cameras and resources was going to be steeper. Luckily, my teammates were able to teach me and guide me through the concepts I did not understand. From the organization/planning stage to the shooting, postproduction and website design, it was a pleasurable experience overall. 

## Naijah
Overall, I’m pleased with the level of organization and communication we maintained in executing this project. By dividing tasks, talking to one another, and keeping everything on a shared document, it was easy to see what part of the process we were in at a given time, and what we had left to do. We all played to our strengths during the process, and writing and shooting was fun! Overall, the most enjoyable project of the semester for sure.

## Sara
I was initially worried about the scale of the project, the amount of equipment we'd have to handle, and the frequency of technicial difficulties. For example, for the:
- News Anchor and Mindreader scenes– we forgot to book the audio equipment, and so we had to use our Phones, which lowered the quality of the recordings just a notch. The lighting also wasn’t great, but we hoped it would be fixable in post-production during the editing process.
- Invisible Girl– The camera kept switching off and we thought it was an issue with batteries, so we switched it out around 3-4 times, delaying and extending the film process and in turn disrupting our planned schedule.
- Superspeed–  We encountered the most issues with the scenes for the superspeed guy. This is because a) the backlighting in our initial recordings cast shadows on the actors, forcing us to refilm the shot, b) the script was too long, and so we had to rewrite it, c) the SD card wasn't loading into the camera when were rerecording, and so we had to film the scene with an iPhone.

My expectations and goals were met for this assignment. I think our group worked very well together— we were all on the same page right from the get-go when we were coming up with our concept, finalizing it from the first day. Even then, we did encounter some scheduling issues, and it was often difficult for all of us to meet at the same time to film a scene. Nonetheless, there was never any conflict, and we were all open to and vocal about changes that needed to be made.
