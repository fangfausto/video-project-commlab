# The Newsroom
## By Sara, Naijah, Sneheel, and Fausto

# What is the project? What is the overall concept and theme? What kind of experience you were striving to create?

For our video project, we wrote, produced, and edited The Newsroom, a The Office-style mockumentary of a breaking news segment that interviews three citizens-turned-superheroes. After the breaking news segment is introduced by news anchor Polly Esther, we follow co-anchor Holly Day around campus as she meets individuals with:
- Powers of invisibility
- Mind reading abilities
- Superspeed
- Spontaneous combustion 

We strove to create a facetious tone to the piece, using names like Polly Esther and Holly Day as a play on words, being overly serious at times to contrast with the sometimes ridiculous responses of the interviewees, and breaking the fourth wall often to let the audience in on the joke. Our tongue-in-cheek news segment centers around superheroes, a theme that allowed us not only to brainstorm several ideas for interesting events that otherwise wouldn’t be possible in the real world, but also to utilize the technical skills of our team members who could use special effects and other editing talents.

The experience we were striving to create was centered largely around letting the film do the talking, while also building the website to accomodate this art form rather than distracting from it. We wanted it to be lighthearted and enjoyable while also displaying some of our technical filmmaking skills.

# How did you go about implementing the concept?
Before we even began filming, we had to storyboard our plan for the film. This meant we had to write a script and then designate a specific shot and movement with an accompanying type of filming equipment. In our case, we used either a:
- Camera
- iPhone

depending on the shot, and then alternated between each.

## Process-- Pre-production
- Brainstorming together, considering different tools/skills we have to inform the ideas we could possibly execute (SFX, editing, coding, etc.)
- Organizing and writing: making a shared google doc, drafting equipment lists
- Scheduling booking times for equipment, having to navigate scarce availability of equipment as everyone is trying to book for their project & capstones are shooting
Couldn't get access to the same lenses on day 2 as we did on day 1

## Process-- Shooting
After writing out our ideas, planning out shot lists, booking our equipment, and handling the logistics, we were able to start shooting. We shot in three different sessions to accommodate the team’s availability and film in the best locations we could find for each scene. 

On Day 1, we filmed the introduction and conclusion scenes with Polly Esther in the studio, as well as the mind reader scene. As these were all indoor, they did not require ND filters. 

On Day 2, we learned a lesson about batteries. We booked several smaller batteries in case any died, but realized that having to constantly change out batteries is a hassle, regardless of if you have enough of them or not. 

We opted for the larger v-lock battery on Day 3, which made shooting much more seamless. We also learned on Day 2 that a wider lens creates a better frame for our images, and so we opted for it on Day 3. 

While shooting, we played around with lighting, moving in and out of shadow, and using the ND filter to properly expose the image while outdoors. We also used the zebra lines setting on the camera to tell when the image was overexposed, and even had to reshoot a scene in a different location once we realized the exposure in the original location was too high. Using these techniques, we got well-exposed video in several different locations for the video.

## Process-- Editing


## Each of our roles were very much multi-disciplinary and well rounded, with each person getting a chance to:
- Script/ storyboard
- Act
- Film
- Handle audio
